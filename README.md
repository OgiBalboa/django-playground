Django trainings
## Django comes with the following design philosophies −

 *   Loosely Coupled − Django aims to make each element of its stack independent of the others.

 *   Less Coding − Less code so in turn a quick development.

  *  Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) − Everything should be developed only in exactly one place instead of repeating it again and again.

  *  Fast Development − Django's philosophy is to do all it can to facilitate hyper-fast development.

  *  Clean Design − Django strictly maintains a clean design throughout its own code and makes it easy to follow best web-development practices.
